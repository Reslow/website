  A project with four other students during the spring 2018 with The swedish forest agency

**The project** was given by The Swedish forest agency. In this project I worked with four other students. We developed a design of an interface for a mobile application that helps forest workers to plan and overview the forest. The Swedish forest agency wished to motivate more workers to use drones in their workday. It was important to develop an interface that forest workers could understand.

## Solution

My forest drone app is a concept of a mobile application that helps forest workers to plan and overview the forest. With the application the user can overview the forest with the drone, and tagg objects that he/she are interested in marking. The app has only the most critical information needed for flying, such as battery strength, height of drone and direction of the drone. The application has different map layers because the map layers view different information.

## Tresure

 When flying a drone it is important to feel in control. A lot of workers in the forest today are not use to new technology
 and needs an application that is easy to use and understand.
  
The projectowner had a plan of gathering image material to train a AI of identifying objects when flying. However there is a fear of feeling watched from users.
I have a theory that users could feel less afraid if they had more control over what is happening. Use of transparency is one way of giving more control to users. Show the users the images that has been gathered, Just a thought..
